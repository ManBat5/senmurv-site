        Our focus is a multi-agent AGI that builds a causal model of the world, forecasts likely futures,
        selects safe actions, and measures impact â€” improving every day without waiting for humans to write
        new rules. Learning is governed: improvements pass through guardrails and canaries, and regressions
        roll back instantly.
